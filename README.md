The purpose of this project is to inform and to involve communities potentially affected by environmental noise pollution (ENP) by means of a web application for desktop. 

Noise pollution is a public health issue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading research bodies.

The scope of this project is to design and implement a web-based application for desktop that allows users to access, retrieve, analyze and visualize, by means of an interactive mapping tool, the available ENP data of a certain local area.

On the website, the user will also be able to find general information regarding the issue of noise pollution, data description and instructions on how to contribute to the data collection since this project aims not only to inform people but also to involve local communities.

The dataset of ENP measurements that will be used in this project comes from Epicollect5 and contains data collected in an specific area of the municipality of Pune, India.

This project is developped under the course of Software Engineering for Geoinformatics at Politecnico di Milano.
